You are hosting a Slavic feast at your home, and you have to choose which guests to invite from a list of options. Each guest has a name, a personality, and a relationship to you. Depending on who you invite, the feast will unfold differently, with various events and outcomes. Here are some possible guests and their descriptions:

- Grandfather Ivan: He is your mother's father, and he is very old and wise. He likes to tell stories and legends, and he knows a lot about Slavic culture and traditions. He is also very strict and conservative, and often scolds guests who do not follow the rules or respect the customs.
- Cousin Olga: She is your father's niece, and she is very young and cheerful. She likes to dance and sing, and she is always looking for fun and adventure. She is also very curious and naive, and often gets into trouble or causes mischief.
- Neighbor Boris: He is your friend and neighbor, and he is very kind and generous. He likes to help and share, and he is always bringing gifts and food. He is also very shy and timid, and often avoids conflicts or confrontations.
- Friend Katya: She is your best friend, and she is very smart and witty. She likes to read and learn, and she is always making jokes and comments. She is also very brave and bold, and often challenges or provokes guests who have different opinions or beliefs.
